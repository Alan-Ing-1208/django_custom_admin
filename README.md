The Custom Admin Dashboard is a Django-based web application designed to provide a modern and user-friendly administrative interface. The project integrates core Django features with Tailwind CSS for a sleek visual layout and Chart.js for dynamic data visualization. It allows administrators to monitor essential metrics like total users, revenue, and recent activities through a customized dashboard that replaces the default Django admin interface.

This project features a custom user registration system where new users can sign up through a form. Upon successful registration, they are redirected to the login page. Once logged in, authenticated users can access the dashboard, which displays real-time data and visual insights using Chart.js. A logout button is conveniently placed on the dashboard for secure session termination. The design emphasizes clarity and responsiveness, ensuring a smooth experience across devices. The charting functionality is powered by a standalone JavaScript file (chart.js) located in the static/js/ directory, which is responsible for rendering a line chart representing revenue trends over time.

To run the Custom Admin Dashboard on your local machine, start by cloning the repository and navigating to the project directory. It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Once inside the environment, install all required packages listed in the requirements.txt file. Then, run Django's migration commands to set up the database schema. You will also need to create a superuser account to log in and access the dashboard.

After setting up, launch the development server using the command python manage.py runserver. In your browser, go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/login/ and log in using your superuser credentials. Once logged in, youâ€™ll be redirected to the custom dashboard where you can view user statistics, revenue data, recent activity, and a dynamic revenue chart powered by Chart.js. Ensure that your static files are correctly linked and that your chart.js file is located under static/js/. With proper configuration, the chart will render automatically, providing a visually engaging summary of data.

This project is a great example of how Django can be extended and customized to build powerful and elegant admin panels. It demonstrates how to combine backend logic with frontend libraries for a complete full-stack experience.
