To run the Custom Admin Dashboard project, clone the repository and ensure Django is installed in your environment. Run python manage.py migrate to apply migrations, then create a superuser using python manage.py createsuperuser. Start the development server with python manage.py runserver and log in to access the admin dashboard. The dashboard features custom user statistics, revenue data, recent activity, and an interactive Chart.js line graph for visual analytics. Static files, including the custom chart configuration, are located under the static/ directory. Make sure all static files are correctly linked, and Chart.js is loaded via CDN or locally. This project combines Django, Tailwind CSS, and Chart.js for a modern, responsive admin interface.
